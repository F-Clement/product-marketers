Product marketers is designed to improve investment strategies for social media marketing companies or individuals who frequently advertise products on social media platforms like Facebook, Youtube, Instagram and Tiktok. Users will be able to improve investment strategy for each product and understand that some products sell better on some platforms than others. In case a new user sells thesame product as an old user, the new user is able to get an investment strategy and start his/her marketing immediatly with the strategy. Thus starting above average and saving some money. A user is also able to delete a product-investment strategy. It is assumed that before using this application, the user usually divides his budget into four equal halves for the different platforms. We also assume that the cost per click here is $2. This application is designed in Python and runs through a terminal.
